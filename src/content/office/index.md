title: Karuna Law Office
logoDescription: >
  This logo was created by Lobsang Tsering. It combines Tibetan Buddhist and
  Native or Indigenous symbolism and art. It is based on the Tibetan Buddhist
  wheel of joy, which is a symbol representing the transformation of the 3 evils
  of ignorance, greed and hatred, into the 3 jewels of Buddha, Dharma, and
  Sangha, which can also be interpreted as God (or Goodness for secular
  persons), Truth, and Caring Community. The logo has been recreated with
  "Canadian" Native or Indigenous art influence.

Karuna Law Office provides legal services to refugees and migrants seeking a secure and positive life in Canada. Karuna is the Sanskrit term for compassion, a deep feeling of kindness that is beyond sympathy, which urges people to take action to alleviate suffering. At Karuna Law Office, we work to help refugees have less suffering in their lives, by helping them obtain greater security and by helping them live in a country in which they have freedom, human rights, and the opportunity to live a productive life with dignity.

An important question for us to ask is whether there can be any justice without compassion. Compassion in practice includes listening carefully and speaking truthfully, with awareness and concern for others' well-being. At Karuna Law Office, we practice generosity, discipline, restraint from harmful speech and actions, patience, not reacting with anger, persevering through hardship with courage and positivity, and using concentration and analytical reasoning to find realistic positive solutions – legal and humanistic – to any apparent problems. We work for compassionate justice in Canada's immigration legal system, and to contribute to the upholding of the aforementioned values that are a vital part of Canada, secular ethical values essential for Canada and the world to be a better place for all.
